# Mel  

Started as a random melody generator, but now the master branch plays random
intervals.  
Other branches:  

* prototype -- here's the original random melody generator.
* rhythm -- add rhythm to the melody.
* pyaudio -- NOT FUNCTIONAL. Attempt to incorporate pyaudio into the mix.
* effect1 -- generates a sound effect.
* interval -- the branch to build from for intervals. 
 
## Usage   

No command line args. The working branches do whatever they do by running:
`python3 mel.py`  
 
## Technology  
 
Mel uses these Python libraries:  
 
* `numpy`
* `simpleaudio`
* `random`
* `pandas`
* `math`
* `pyaudio` 
 
## Credits  

Got lots of ideas from Bart and pdx-cs-sound.
